Random Forest Classifier Model Description

The Random Forest Classifier model is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees. This model is used in the project to predict the malignancy of breast tumors using the same Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Random Forest improves upon the simplicity of decision trees by adding robustness and reducing the risk of overfitting through ensemble learning. It handles the binary classification of tumors by analyzing various features extracted from the cell nuclei images, aggregating the predictions from multiple decision trees to decide on the tumor's nature. This model is highly favored for its performance, ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality, and its proficiency in managing both numerical and categorical data. The Random Forest Classifier's inherent ability to rank the importance of different features for the classification task makes it invaluable for identifying critical factors contributing to breast cancer, thereby providing insights into the disease's nature and aiding in more informed medical decision-making.
